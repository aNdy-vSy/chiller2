                 Instructions                  
===============================================       

On the title screen, select either to play as
the boy or the girl by pulling left or right on
the joystick.  The boy is ' stronger' than the
girl so can take collisions and lose energy a
little slower than the girl.  However, the girl
is a little lighter than the boy, so when
jumping will stay in the air just a fraction
longer making it easier to cross larger gaps or
reach higher platforms.

Press fire to play from level 1 or press 'F7'
to play from the level reached in the last
game.

The aim of the game is to collect 20 crosses on
each level to progress to the next level.  Each
cross collected adds '1' to the cross counter
in the middle of the status panel at the bottom
of the screen and '100' to your score on the
left of the status panel. 
   
Move your character around the level using the
joystick, left and right to move.  A single
fire button press activates 'jump'.  Holding
down fire enables a 'double jump' - some
'platforms' may initially appear too high to
reach with one fire button press, so holding
down the button and double-jumping means your
character will jump up to a platform and
then jump again automatically when touching
a high platform.

Gravity is always active in the game, so
walking off the edge of a platform will result
in your character falling down the screen.
There is no limit as to how high you can fall
from and no energy is lost on landing.

If your character touches an enemy or certain
parts of the scenery, such as mushrooms, then
energy is lost from your energy bar at the very
bottom of the status panel.  Mushrooms will only
drain energy if they are walked over or fallen 
on.  You can jump up through or past them without 
losing any energy.

When a level is complete, your energy is reset
to full and you gain an extra 1000 points.

The game ends when you run out of energy.

Chiller 2 has been deliberately designed to be
a very challenging game.  As a result of this,
initially you may play just to complete each
level.  As mentioned, you can always use 'F7'
to play from the last level you reached before
you ran out of energy.  However, after each
restart your score resets to '0'.

The ultimate aim would be to play through,
completing all 12 levels without using the
restart from last level function and then
loop the game and carry on, trying to achieve
the highest score you can!

===============================================
                 Hints & Tips                  
=============================================== 

Although the player characters can move
relatively quickly, rushing around is a
guaranteed way of losing energy very quickly,
ending the game.

Collision with enemies is quite 'loose' so
they can often be passed without energy loss
even if a few pixels of your character are
overlapping with them.

Each level has been purposefully designed to be
a type of 'puzzle' with some routes through
being more optimal than others. Take your time
and plan your path.

There is no time limit so you can stop and
think.  There are safe places on the levels
where you can stand without fear of enemies
crashing into you, so it's always a good idea
to seek these out before looking for and
collecting crosses!

While stopping, watch and learn the enemy
patrol routes.  Timing your jumps between and
over them will result in more success.
